fuzzywuzzy
whois
Pillow
matplotlib
You can install the required packages using the following pip commands:

nginx

Logs and History:

Scan Logs: The scan results are saved in a text file called scan_logs.txt. Each scan entry includes the timestamp, scanned URL, and results of the security checks.
Scan History: The application keeps a history of all scans, which can be accessed by clicking the "Show Scan History" button.
Troubleshooting:

No QR Code Detected: If no QR code is detected from the image or camera feed, ensure that the image has a valid QR code and that the camera is working properly.
No Internet Connection: Ensure you are connected to the internet to allow the application to check URLs and perform whois lookups, redirects, and domain validation.
Module Not Found: If you get a ModuleNotFoundError, ensure that all required libraries are installed. Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install them.
